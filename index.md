## Welcome to Zoe Wang's Portfolio

Below are my projects, from newest to oldest. I'm still learning with every project...everyone starts somewhere!

## STATS 101C FINAL PROJECT
I am most proud of my work on this project. I created the best model and we placed 11th in our Kaggle competition (out of 30+ groups). I learned the ins and outs of Random Forest with this.

The goal of this project was to predict the growth in viewership of a Youtube video. The original dataset had 250+ predictors, and I narrowed it down to around 70 relevant predictors.

Looking back, here are a few changes I would make:
- There was a predictor called PublishedDate which had dates in the form 12/10/2020 11:11PM, which I deleted. However, I should have dissected it and created new predictors using it.
- Other predictors were similar, such as different features of the thumnail; these could have been combined/fused to create new predictors as well.

## STATS 101C MIDTERM PROJECT
This class taught us many new techniques and introduced us to classification methods. For this midterm, we were tasked with classifying cancer-causing genes. I found this to be a rather difficult but interesting project.

I had never worked with data this large and it was admittedly quite difficult to transition from working with small datasets for homework to being presented with a huge dataset and no hint on what methods to try.

## STATS 101B FINAL PROJECT
This class delved into categorical variables. This project tasked us with exploring the virtual "Island" and to experience the time it takes to actually sample and record data. 

The topic we chose to investigate was the relationship between listening to various genres of music and pain reception.

## STATS 101A FINAL PROJECT 
This class was to teach us the basics of regression. This project was difficult as it was the first time I had ever worked with real data and received no hint on what direction to go. As a starting off point, it is not bad! Take a look for yourself and see.
