## Welcome to Zoe Wang's Portfolio

I don't claim to be the best at data science, but I'm learning with every project. Everyone starts somewhere!

Below are my projects, from newest to oldest.

# STATS 101C FINAL PROJECT
# STATS 101C MIDTERM PROJECT
# STATS 101B FINAL PROJECT

# STATS 101A FINAL PROJECT
This class was to teach us the basics of regression. This project was difficult as it was the first time I had ever worked with real data and received no hint on what direction to go. As a starting off point, it is not bad! Take a look for yourself and see.
